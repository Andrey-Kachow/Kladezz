# Three Rs

So I thought that the three Rs rule for saving environment can be pushed to the limit with maths.

## Reduce

Generally, It is a good idea to consume as few products as possible.
It is hard to achieve completely in these days.
Also I am agaist restricting yourself from having cool stuff.
I am not against individiualism.
However in order to protect nature each of us has to consider what they really need.
But restricting yourself from having stuff also limits your further choices.

For example, if you buy a board game that you never end up playing, you wasted some paper and plastic.
But if you never had it, you never have a chance to play it.
You don't have a choice to invite your friends and play that game together.
But once the purchase have been made, how many game sessions would make the sacrifice of precious tree that was chopped worth it?
Should you play as much as possibe to utilise the resource you have?

The sollution for that problem may be never buying the game, but instead going to boardgame pub.
On the first glance communal item reduce waste.
But that is arguable.
Consider two cases where in the first case a single box of Monopoly is used by 25 people in a pub.
And in the other case every single person owns a Monopoly and they play with their group of friends.
The box that is used by 25 people will quickly become unplayable.
Cards may get crumpled and dice can get lost.
The new box might be required to replace the incomplete game.
In contrast, when an individual owns the game, it is rarely used and serves longer.
Communal items are usually used with less care, because there is no direct ownership.
The issue of a pub losing monopoly is not a problem, because the incident of a game becoming unusable is partially included in the price.
